A React Native starter repo with the aim to implement scalable "gold star" standards from the get go.

## Intro

2. React Native
3. Redux, Redux-Thunk
4. React Native Debugger
5. React Navigation
6. Axios
7. Formik and Auth forms
8. Basic screens

> We'll probably sprinkle some Lodash/FP in there to get things going.
